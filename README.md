## Overview

GameShop is a simple shopping cart application that allows users to browse video games, add them to a cart, and proceed to a dummy checkout. The application features a clean, modern UI with dark mode support and is fully responsive across devices. <br/> <br/>
This project is part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and was built to practice building a React single-page-application with browser navigation and writing tests for UI components. It was also the first project I built using TailwindCSS for component styling.
